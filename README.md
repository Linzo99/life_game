# Conway's Game of Life Implementation

## Overview

This provides an overview of the implementation solution for Conway's Game of Life, from TL221 Challenge. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Conway, and it's known for its simple yet fascinating rules that govern the evolution of the system.

### Rules of Conway's Game of Life

The following are the basic rules that govern the evolution of the system:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).

### Running the Code

To run the Game of Life implementation:

1. Visit this [link](https://life-game-156wek3f9-linzo99.vercel.app/)
2. Clone this repository and run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Linzo99/life_game.git
```
